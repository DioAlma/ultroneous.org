# Source code of ultroneous.org

The development environment should have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed.

To run a local copy of the site:
```
make test
```

It will say it's serving on `http://0.0.0.0:4000`, within the Docker container, but actually it will be accessible on `http://127.0.0.1:4000`, on the host machine.

To check for methods that haven't been integrated or written:
```
make check
```

It will print to standard output.


## Guide to the repository

The top-level files are:
- `Dockerfile`
- `LICENSE`
- `Makefile`
- `README.md`

These are tools for developers.

The top-level directories are:
- `build`
- `library`
- `source`

These are used by the Dockerfile and Makefile to generate the website.

`build` is not included in the repository; it's generated by `make`, and populated by `jekyll`.

`library` contains scripts used by `make`.

`source` contains code, templates, and data for `jekyll` to generate the website in `build`.
