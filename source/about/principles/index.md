title: How do we work together?
---

Working together is an endless path of learning. Along the way we discover sources of knowledge left by those who went before us. When we find them, we pick them up, and we keep them here, to remind us of where we're going.

{% newthought "Following love" %} is our first principle. It can also be called "living fearlessly". We cultivate trust in ourselves, others, and all that is, with [Dragon Dreaming](http://www.dragondreaming.org/), [Circling](http://www.circlinginstitute.com/circling/what-is-circling/), the [Wheel of Consent](https://bettymartin.org/videos/), and [A Course in Miracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Course_in_Miracles).

{% newthought "Learning and improving," %} with relentless determination, is our second principle. We study and practice the ways of [kaizen culture]({% post_url 2016-12-25-kaizen-culture %}) and [permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture), the [Metaphysics of Quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirsig%27s_metaphysics_of_Quality) and the methods of the [Center for Applied Rationality](http://rationality.org/).

{% newthought "Organizing cooperatively" %} is our third principle. We work as a sociocratic cooperative, according to [the Rochdale principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles) and [the principles of sociocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy), using the frameworks of [Sustaining Change](https://www.worldcat.org/title/sustaining-change-leadership-that-works/oclc/647780103&referer=brief_results) and [The Leader's Guide to Storytelling](https://www.worldcat.org/title/leaders-guide-to-storytelling-mastering-the-art-and-discipline-of-business-narrative/oclc/865021458&referer=brief_results), and the secrets of [The One-Minute Manager](https://www.worldcat.org/title/one-minute-manager/oclc/881463988&referer=brief_results).

{% newthought "Holding to the truth" %} is our final principle. We also call it "principle zero", because it is the principle we derive all others from. We seek to understand [Satyagraha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagraha).

All of our principles are open to change, as we know that we know nothing next to what can be known, and we are always learning more of the truth.
