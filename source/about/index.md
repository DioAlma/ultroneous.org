I'm just going to call it a blog. That's close enough.

{% newthought "I'm the author." %} My name is Spencer Campbell.{% sidenote "*Spencer* comes from [*dispensƒÅtor*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dispensator#Latin), in Latin. *Campbell* comes from [*cam*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cam#Scottish_Gaelic) and [*beul*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beul#Scottish_Gaelic), in Gaelic. My name means \"administrator of wry mouth\", which fits pretty well." %}

I live in Portugal, in [Tamera](http://tamera.org), an ecovillage and peace research center.

{% newthought "My main goal here" %} is to build up a common language with my readership.

Sometimes I write articles, which are more about ideas, and sometimes I write journals, which are more about my life.{% sidenote "Sometimes -- though not so often -- I write plays, to show rather than tell something." %}

{% newthought "What else?" %} You can write comments at the bottom of any page.

If you have more questions, please ask!
