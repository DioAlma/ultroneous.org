The first time we called ourselves a cooperative was on September 9th, 2017. We wanted to work together. Long before we spoke about what we would do, that was clear. Before we even met, we read a book called [The One-Minute Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_Minute_Manager), sixty pages long and written like a childrens' story, to give ourselves a simple common language for setting goals and working toward them together.

We were a team of three. At the start, one of us was the boss, telling the others what to do. The first thing the boss did was to train the others in a very simple way of deciding by consent, with roots in the tradition of [Sociocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy), so that, after a couple months, there wasn't a boss anymore. We all knew how to make decisions that we would all go along with, so we didn't need anyone to make decisions for us.

Meanwhile, we were learning to speak the truth. We were the most impractical working team you can imagine. We didn't say one word about work until we had told our life stories. It was important to know who we were, and what we truly cared about, if we were going to work together. We weren't about to make the mistake of working for anything other than what we care about more than anything else.

Veda is a way of working together.
