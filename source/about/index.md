It started as a blog, and now it's becoming a communication platform for Veda, [an emerging unbusiness cooperative]({% post_url 2017-08-19-cooperative %}).

{% newthought "Veda Cooperative" %} is based on the [seven Rochdale principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles), the [three core tenets of permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture#Core_tenets_and_principles_of_design), and the [14 principles of the Toyota Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way).

We are in the process of integrating these and other sources of knowledge about working together with people and planet into a written statement of our ethics, principles, vision and mission, to be published here at a later time.
