This is a collection of links to other works that influenced my thinking, organized by related topics.

## Language

The book [GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) is a good starting point.

[Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander) is practically required reading.{% sidenote "As of now I've only read [The Timeless Way of Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building), I have to admit." %}

*Cultural Literacy*, by [E. D. Hirsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._D._Hirsch), is one of the first books I read that addresses the deep connections between language, knowledge, culture and education.

## Love

[Eros Unredeemed](http://verlag-meiga.org/shop/eros-unredeemed-the-world-power-of-sexuality/), by [Dieter Duhm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Duhm), helped me a *lot* to formulate my thinking around erotic love -- particularly in the social and cultural consequences of it.

## Trust

[The Continuum Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_concept), by [Jean Liedloff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Liedloff), had an enormous positive impact on my childhood. Much later, when I read it myself, it had an enormous positive impact on me, too.

## Lucidity

[Stanislav Grof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Grof) was important for me to begin understanding what *mind* is. I recommend *Beyond the Brain*.

## Chaos

I owe an enormous debt to Jenna Katerin Moran for writing [Hitherby Dragons](http://hitherby.com/). More recent work is [here](http://books.hitherby.com/).
