    - "I experienced a moment of mental quiet, readiness and curiosity."
    - "I'm looking at my private to-do list."
    - "My attention is gliding off of the tasks there, because they seem irrelevant to me at the moment."
    - "My attention is wandering to the way I'm recording observations."
    - "I'm wondering if it would be an improvement to change the data structure so that each entry contains only one notes, because it seems each note carries a different quality."
    - "I'm deciding to commit my observations, then change my Vim macro, and change the observation data structure."
