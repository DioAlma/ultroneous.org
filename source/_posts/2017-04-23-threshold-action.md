I feel like something is about to happen.

As I gradually develop a stronger and stronger [will to arrive]({% post_url 2017-01-09-will-to-arrive %}), I find myself experiencing this sensation more often and more acutely.

I still don't cross the threshold, more often than not. I come just to the edge.

{% newthought "As one example," %} it seems like it's time for me to publicize this blog. The original intention of it was to build a [common language]({% post_url 2016-12-21-winter-solstice %}), and hiding its existence doesn't serve that goal.

I've been playing with ideas of how to do it. It could be as simple as broadcasting a message to everyone I know, saying, "here I am". I think I can do better than this, though.

I can, at the very least, ask you to leave comments, having now built up [the will to receive]({% post_url 2017-01-08-will-to-receive %}) them.

{% newthought "At the other extreme," %} I'm considering signing up with [Book in a Box](http://bookinabox.com/), with the aim of attracting a dedicated readership a year or so later.

A handful of thoughts lie at the core of everything I write here. What would happen if I put all those thoughts in a book, and let that book be read by a large number of people?

Could I hold that kind of attention? What would I do with it?

That's assuming each node actually knows the others exist, though. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Metcalfe-Network-Effect.svg)" %}
{% newthought "I think," %} before I can make a sincere invitation, I would need some idea of where I want you to go. I would need a program that goes beyond "please read what I write and leave comments", yet doesn't leap all the way to "build a whole new world" in one step.

One idea was to create a page here with a list of profiles, belonging to all the people in my life who consent to be public figures. It would provide a platform where a network could emerge, with communication between many different people in it, and not only between me and others.

{% newthought "The question is," %} where would I wish that network to direct its effort?

I want more people to live the way I live, because, compared to what's normal for almost anyone alive in this day and age, I live in paradise.

I want more intelligence working to develop this way of life further, because, compared to what I can imagine as realistically attainable in my lifetime, I live in misery.

As an abstract vision, this is very clear to me, but I know from experience that an abstract vision isn't sufficient to motivate people into concrete action.

What project would I invite you to join, as a way toward this vision?

At the same time, it's obvious that Tamera isn't good enough, and I'm not sure it can improve fast enough. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tamera_-_Aerial_Lake_1,_Aula,_Campus.jpg)" %}
{% newthought "At this point" %} I come to the boundary of my own clarity. Whatever project I would name, I would need to be part of it, and at the moment I'm not in any project that I have real confidence in.

So, as a start: dear friends, would you please leave comments below?

I have three questions:

Can you imagine the world I want to go to? If so,

Do you want to go there with me? If so,

What's the first step you think we should take?
