title: Setting Priorities

In the last month, it's become very clear that I need to meet certain objectives in the near future. I want to make a list of these, because I'm returning to Tamera tomorrow, and most likely everything will change again after that.

I won't try to explain why these are my priorities, now. My way of finding them was half reason and half intuition, and both halves took in so much data that it would be a fool's errand to reconstruct how they arrived at the conclusions they did.

{% newthought "I need to form" %} a [household]({% post_url 2017-02-14-new-kind-household %}), and it looks like I need to be the father of some kids in it.

It will have a [kanban]({% post_url 2016-12-25-kaizen-culture %}), and it will be a boiling cauldron of cultural innovation. Beyond that, I can't say what it's going to be, exactly.

If I'm right about what the universe has in store for me, this will be my main project for the foreseeable future.{% sidenote "A quarter of a decade, more or less." %} When I do anything else, it's going to be within the context of my household; all the following priorities only make sense in light of this one.

{% newthought "I need to become" %} somebody's lover.

I'm using the word "lover" carefully, here. I don't know a term that means exactly what I want to say. "Love partner" might fit better, with the same kind of connotation as "business partner". I'm imagining a very serious, committed relationship. The reason and purpose of it is love, but not love as a means of mitigating loneliness -- more like love as a means of spiritual development.

{% newthought "I need to learn" %} how to physically subdue someone, without doing any harm. This became evident after several encounters with angry people, plus being witness to a conflict between parent and child.

In the end, the parent got the child in a firm grappling hold, with no freedom of movement at all. After the pair of them had stayed locked together like that for a while, calm prevailed. They transitioned seamlessly into cuddling. It wasn't a good situation, but the way it resolved was impressive.

I foresee that I might find myself in situations where I'm called to do the same, but with adults.

{% newthought "I also need to learn" %} a certain way of agriculture, which it isn't really right to call "agriculture" at all. I'm not even sure that anyone practices this, today, except for animals not of my species.

The closest example I know of is called [natural farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_farming), which involves no tillage, no fertilizer, no pesticides or herbicides, no weeding and no pruning.

That's almost exactly it. The only thing I would add is: "no farm".

{% newthought "Finally, I need to practice" %} building with clay. I threw a good deal of [cob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cob_(material)) in the last month. In theory, I know enough now to build an entire house with nothing but a bucket, a hoe, water, earth, and weeds.

It seems very worthwhile to put that theory into practice.

{% newthought "I'm imagining" %} a scene that might manifest in the foreseeable future: waking up in the house that I built, going out among the trees, harvesting this, planting that, reshaping the earth a bit to better retain the rain, taking a bit from what I dug, going back, adding it to my house, or another one.

All of that alongside others, of all generations, doing the same or similar. I see them after the morning's work in the village bath house; we talk a bit, and stay together for lunch in the dining hall.

We're still together afterward, in the community meeting, to weave and reweave the social fabric, creating beautiful new patterns and working out the knots. We integrate some new ones into society -- some coming from birth, others from travel. Later we speak and hear about recent interpersonal conflicts, then play a language-reinventing game.

The result is a new word added to our dictionary, might mean "gift" or "attack", depending on context. The most obvious use case is to say, "thank you for the (...)", after being told something incredibly painful that was meant to help.

We only part ways in the evening. I take some time to do yoga and meditate, or pray, or chant or sing, or write blog posts, or whatever it is I do, to process the day's events, before I go to meet my partner.

An ordinary day.
