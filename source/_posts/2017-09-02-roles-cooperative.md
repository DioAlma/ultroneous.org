In [the previous journal entry]({% post_url 2017-07-09-remaking-relationship %}), I posed a question. I didn't finish answering it that time, and I won't this time, either.

{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Facebook_icon_2013.svg" "Facebook is to social networks what a hammer is to a house. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Facebook_icon_2013.svg)" %}
The question is: why does this blog exist, and what does Facebook have to do with it?

{% newthought "Ten days ago," %} I wrote an article called [A Cooperative]({% post_url 2017-08-19-cooperative%}), at the same time that I started to gather a team to form something like what I describe there. Since then I feel like I'm surrounded by people interested in joining my team-that-doesn't-exist as part of my cooperative-that-doesn't-exist.

I wish I could simply say, "Yes, come!" The only problem is, there's nothing to come into, yet. It still needs to be created.

{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Social_Network.png" "Counting networks is tricky business. Technically, there's only one network on Earth, with everyone connected to everyone. I count each highly connected cluster of people as an individual network, and I have no precise definition for \"highly connected\".

{% newthought "The way I think" %} about the process of forming a cooperative involves three concepts: teams, roles, and networks.

At the moment my cooperative has no teams or roles, and at least four active networks, with something like half a dozen more that I could call on. The active networks include [Tamera](http://tamera.org), which is me and most of my connections; Diogo and his connections; Cedric and his connections; and my online circling group, which includes Marc, Shirley, Barbara, and their connections.

The people I just named have all commented on this blog. I'm generally careful not to make someone a public figure or reveal their connection to me without their consent; how you're seen on the web can have a big impact on your life, and I want to give you control over how I contribute to that.

{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Neural_network_bottleneck_achitecture.svg" "Healthy networks have robust channels of information flow, without any narrow bottlenecks. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Neural_network_bottleneck_achitecture.svg)" %}
{% newthought "That being said," %} it's very useful for me to be able to name you publically here, and to talk about you and how you relate to me. It's a way to weave these different networks together, when at present there are very few connections between them all -- in some cases, the only connection goes through me.

For that reason, I want to use this journal entry to create a role. I call it "network link". If you agree to take it, you're formally part of my cooperative, and you're allowed to say "my cooperative" to refer to the same not-quite-existing entity that I do.

{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Stack_of_Copy_Paper.jpg/640px-Stack_of_Copy_Paper.jpg" "In Portuguese, the word for \"role\" is \"[papel](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/papel#Portuguese)\", referring to the stack of papers that tells you your role as an actor in a play. I find this very appropriate: it's a description of what's expected from you. \"Role\" has similar etymology, but it's less obvious: it's a roll of papyrus. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stack_of_Copy_Paper.jpg)" %}
A role is a formal relationship, and as a relationship it consists of expectations.

{% newthought "As a network link," %} you're expected to communicate offers and requests between the cooperative and the network of people and organizations you're connected to. It's a role that requires paying attention to needs and capabilities, and translating those observations into language to form agreements for cooperation.

To do that, I would first make it known in my network that I'm in this role, so that the people I'm connected to know that they can address my cooperative through me. Then, I would actively look for opportunities to create cooperation. For example, [Tamera offers online courses](http://terranova.tamera.org/); I might propose to the cooperative that we make a webpage to gather offerings of this sort.

Most of the work is to formulate what you ask for or offer. A clear ask is amazingly powerful; if you don't believe me, [listen to Amanda Palmer](https://youtu.be/xMj_P_6H69g).

An excellent network link knows how to communicate effectively, as a way to create cooperation. "Will you ...?" is a more effective way to make a request than "It would be great if ...", because it's a clear question, not a comment loaded with subtext. Simplicity and directness are valuable, here.

{% newthought "As a first request," %} I want to create a page of profiles for the various people who take roles like this, and I don't anticipate that I'll have time to do that in the next few weeks.

Will you find someone who knows HTML, CSS and Javascript, and wants to contribute a few hours of work to make more faces visible in this place?

I made an open source code repository for the site, which you can find [here](https://github.com/ultroneous-org/ultroneous.org). That should be enough information for someone to contribute, if they already have the right skills for the job.

{% newthought "Other ideas for cooperation" %} will go on [this page](/cooperation),{% sidenote "UPDATE: As of 2017-09-24, the cooperation page was eliminated, in favor of using [Kanboard](https://kanboard.net/)." %} as they arise.

It's a very modest start. Hopefully it's enough for those of you who want to get involved, right here and right now, to contribute your time, energy and intelligence in a meaningful way.

If not, or if you have any other ideas for cooperation, please let us know in the comments.
