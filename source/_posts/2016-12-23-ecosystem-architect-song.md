(a musical interlude){% marginnote "Disclaimer: self-parody ensues." %}

I am the very model of an ecosystem architect,{% sidenote "[Original](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major-General%27s_Song)." %}

developing new answers for the world of which we've made a wreck.

I work all day and night, with [loving grace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Watched_Over_by_Machines_of_Loving_Grace) and [rationality](http://lesswrong.com/),

to build the infrastructure of eudaemonic eternity.

(take a breath)

While all the monster boys and girls are sleeping snugly in their beds --

and all the planet's burning on the coals of our forgotten debts --

a few of us are still awake and wond'ring how to make it through,

(ASIDE: "Hmm, but actually, how ... ah, got it!")

so let's make [forest gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_gardening) and inhabit planet Earth anew!


(CHORUS)

SO LET'S MAKE FOREST GARDENS AND INHABIT PLANET EARTH ANEW

SO LET'S MAKE FOREST GARDENS AND INHABIT PLANET EARTH ANEW

SO LET'S MAKE FOREST GARDENS AND INHABIT PLANET EARTH A-NEWY-NEW


Where [Bucky Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller) left I started to create my own theory,

of how it all went wrong and led to systematic misery.

Like you I have a role to play and crucial action to effect,

I am the very model of an ecosystem architect.


(CHORUS)

LIKE YOU HE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY AND CRUCIAL ACTION TO EFFECT,

HE IS THE VERY MODEL OF AN ECOSYSTEM ARCHITECT.


I don't mean to imply that I have all the answers ready-made,

but to the ones who doubt we can survive I simply have to say,

if you knew half of what I know you'd long ago have realized:

the mind's the only obstacle to everlasting paradise.

(take a breath)

By following some [simple rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence#Boids_.28Reynolds_1987.29) to decentrally co-create,

emergent structure will from chaos help us all to orchestrate

the reconciliation of all enemies and nation-states.

(ASIDE: "And what comes next ... ? Yes, of course!")

With fractal living systems the whole universe we'll tessellate!


(CHORUS)

WITH FRACTAL LIVING SYSTEMS THE WHOLE UNIVERSE WE'LL TESSELLATE!

WITH FRACTAL LIVING SYSTEMS THE WHOLE UNIVERSE WE'LL TESSELLATE!

WITH FRACTAL LIVING SYSTEMS THE WHOLE UNIVERSE WE'LL TESSELL-ESSELL-ATE!


And so, you see, the path ahead is very clear straight and direct,

all that we need is harmony and to all sacred life protect.

Like you I have a role to play and crucial action to effect,

I am the very model of an ecosystem architect.


(CHORUS)

LIKE YOU HE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY AND CRUCIAL ACTION TO EFFECT,

HE IS THE VERY MODEL OF AN ECOSYSTEM ARCHITECT.


With all that said I think you are most certainly sure to agree,

that you can go and implement all that's been said apart from me,

while I stay back and from my armchair freely psychoanalyze,

and in no way participate in what I see before my eyes.

(take a breath)

My practical abilities leave something much to be desired,

I can't cook clean or tie my shoes nor do whatever else required --

I know not how to pay my bills, my social skills are incorrect --

(ASIDE: "Hang on, is it rude to introduce oneself in musical verse ... ? Ah, screw it.")

yet all that matters not because the future needs an architect!


(CHORUS)

YET ALL THAT MATTERS NOT BECAUSE THE FUTURE NEEDS AN ARCHITECT!

YET ALL THAT MATTERS NOT BECAUSE THE FUTURE NEEDS AN ARCHITECT!

YET ALL THAT MATTERS NOT BECAUSE THE FUTURE NEEDS ANOTHER ARCHITECT!


As human being I lack the sense to tell a window from a door,

if not for friends and family I'd be a lump upon the floor.

But still I have a role to play and crucial action to effect,

I am the very model of an ecosystem architect.


(CHORUS)

BUT STILL HE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY AND CRUCIAL ACTION TO EFFECT,

HE IS THE VERY MODEL OF AN ECOSYSTEM ARCHITECT.
