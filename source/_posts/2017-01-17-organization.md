Last summer, "organization" became the most important word in my life.

I was the main one responsible for a common kitchen,{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Lha_Community_Soup_Kitchen.jpg/320px-Lha_Community_Soup_Kitchen.jpg" "To understand a culture, see how it eats. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lha_Community_Soup_Kitchen.jpg)" %} in Tamera, for two weeks. It was my favorite time in the whole year. I went into it with fifty issues in my life, and I came out with only one: organization.

I could trace everything, all the problems that I face in my life right now, big or small, to disorganization. I'm not using the word in the usual sense, though.

{% newthought "A well-organized system" %} is one able to respond well to the needs that emerge in it. The best example is a living organism;{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Eukaryotic_Cell_%28animal%29.jpg/320px-Eukaryotic_Cell_%28animal%29.jpg" "An organism is an organization of organs organized from cells of organelles. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eukaryotic_Cell_(animal).jpg)" %} you can look at your own body. You might take an unlucky step, and get a thorn stuck in your toe. Your *whole* body responds, then, to take the thorn out.

What percentage of your body is your little toe? It must be less than one part in ten thousand. Imagine yourself in a community as well-organized as your body; if you got hurt, *ten thousand people* would immediately adjust their lives in response. No one would be particularly inconvenienced -- it's not difficult to take a thorn out of your toe, usually -- and you'd be well again in no time.

{% newthought "After those two weeks," %} I made a forum performance{% sidenote "I can't find a good description of what \"forum\" is, online. A mix between improv theater and deep listening." %} about organization. There was no content to it: I just said "I am an easy organ" or "I am an organ of God", a million times, and the last time I said it I was able to reach deep down inside myself to a place I haven't touched so often.

I felt grief,{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Well.handdug.cased.mali.jpg/320px-Well.handdug.cased.mali.jpg" "The well is deep. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Well.handdug.cased.mali.jpg)" %} huge and absolute, for the magnitude of the gap between life as I've experienced it and life as I can imagine it. I have *several* thorns stuck in me, and I'm one of the very luckiest ones. It's been like this for a long time, and no meaningful help seems to be on its way.

For some reason the experience was empowering, and not discouraging. It pointed me in a certain direction, even if it didn't make it completely clear what I'll find on the way.

{% newthought "Next month," %} I'm going to stay with [the friend I mentioned in another post]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2017-01-09-will-to-arrive %}) for four weeks. I have an outer vision and an inner intention, for the time.

The vision is to support the emergence of healthy, autonomous ecovillages in the [Sado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sado_River) river basin.{% sidenote "Over 11 days in October, I walked the whole length of the Sado, from the south to the north, as part of the [Caminhada pela Agua](https://youtu.be/YfV_BzZ9K70). I've seen a significant part of the [river basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin) where I live." %}

The intention is organization.

It's very likely that, in the intersection of these two things, I'll take responsibility for another common kitchen -- for four weeks, instead of two. I'll also have more support, and more freedom to experiment. I can try out all sorts of ideas that I didn't have the time or the daring to try during the summer.

Where does the food come from?{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Glucose_metabolism.svg/309px-Glucose_metabolism.svg.png" "Who digests it? Who carries the nutrients to the cells? [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Glucose_metabolism.svg)" %} Who cooks it? How many will come to eat? Who cleans the dishes after? How do we organize all these things, and who makes the decisions about it?

{% newthought "Every intentional community" %} has problems with these questions, as far as I know. If you really want community, you *need* a common kitchen, and a common kitchen is an enormously complex thing. Even moreso if it includes a garden, which it should. Either way, the full spectrum of human issues are present: love, money, power, communication, creativity, everything. It touches the whole of life.

There is no problem in this world that cannot be solved in the kitchen.
