It's been two weeks since the start of my [one-month community organization experiment]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2017-01-17-organization %}), and it's already a magnificent success.{% sidenote "That is to say: the whole thing collapsed decisively on day ten. That's what a successful experiment looks like, most of the time!" %}

{% newthought "So far," %} here's what I've learned:

The person I was two weeks ago, when given two cooperative friends and control of a kitchen, immediately becomes a tyrannical madman.{% sidenote "Fortunately, my friends are forgiving, and willing to tell me to my face when I'm being a \"little Hitler\". (After building up courage for a week or so.)" %}

It's senseless to act like a leader when you aren't comfortable in your own skin.

[Kanban]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-12-25-kaizen-culture %}) actually works. (!)

I'm a passably good [scrum master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Scrum_Master). (!!)

Reading the [free ebook](http://www.dragondreaming.org/about-us/the-international-e-book/) of [Dragon Dreaming](http://www.dragondreaming.org/) was a very good idea.{% sidenote "Also, *Dream, Plan, Do,* and *Celebrate* make quite good general-purpose kanban columns. (!!!)" %}

A good partnership makes everything possible, and a bad partnership makes everything terrible.

It's wise to read [The Continuum Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_concept) as soon as humanly possible, no matter who you are or what you think your life is about.

Authenticity is the better part of humility.{% sidenote "Step one: act as confident as you are." %}

{% newthought "Today I'm on the verge" %} of learning something else. I'm not quite ready to say I think it's true; I'm still grasping at the meaning of it. If I had to put it into words now, I might say:

I need to get married.{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Wedding_rings.jpg/320px-Wedding_rings.jpg" "We're gonna need more of these. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wedding_rings.jpg)" %}

{% newthought "A month ago" %} I had an amazingly rewarding conversation with someone I barely knew. I had too many open questions in my life, too big for me to answer alone, and I came to the realization that, for whatever reason, I wouldn't listen to anything anyone else said about it except for *this one guy*.

So, I asked him to go on a walk with me. We walked around for an hour or more. I started by telling him my most urgent questions, based on my [four resolutions]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-12-21-winter-solstice %}) condensed into conversationally tractable form:

1. Who am I home with?
2. Who do I work with?
3. Who do I love?

We focused on the first and second questions, leaving the third for another day.

{% newthought "I use the word \"home\"" %} to refer to something very esoteric.{% sidenote "If you're the esoteric type, maybe you'll get this: \"home\" is about [m큰l훮dh훮ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muladhara)." %} I'm actually translating a more appropriate word from Ancient Greek: "[oikos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BF%E1%BC%B6%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek)", pronounced something like "eckous", which is the etymological root of both "economy" and "ecology".

It's a certain quality that can be more or less present in daily life. "Home" means no worries about the basic things. It doesn't imply an *easy* life, nor a life without worry. It's less about "comfort" in the sense of convenience, and more about comfort in the sense of familiarity, stability, reliability and security.{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/McDonalds_in_Dubai_3.JPG/311px-McDonalds_in_Dubai_3.JPG" "Home can also be used for evil purposes. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:McDonalds_in_Dubai_3.JPG)" %}

If I have to walk for five hours through blistering heat to carry dirty water from the river, so that my family will have something to drink, *and we've never lacked water for all the years I've done this,* I'm likely to feel home. But if I normally get pure spring water from the tap on demand, in my climate-controlled house, *and half the time no water comes out*, I'm not at all likely to feel home.

I can honestly say I've felt at home, most of the time, throughout my life. It hasn't mattered where I am; I carry home with me. My expectation of still being alive and well, at the end of the day, is very high -- and so far that expectation has always been met.

So, I don't mean to give the impression that I'm searching for home. Rather, the trouble is that I have no company, and I'm in the process of learning [how to change that]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2017-01-08-will-to-receive %}).

{% newthought "During that conversation," %} it seemed like the answer to "who am I home with" was standing right in front of me. I said, half-joking, that I wanted to marry him and his wife.{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/A_Horse_Walks_Into_A_Bar.jpg/320px-A_Horse_Walks_Into_A_Bar.jpg" "\"I want to marry you and your wife\", he said, while the horse walked into the bar. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_Horse_Walks_Into_A_Bar.jpg)" %}

The half-serious part is what I want to focus on. Who do I need to become, to be able to make that proposal seriously -- perhaps in other words -- and deal with what comes after, if the response is a "yes"?

{% newthought "For some months now," %} I've had a vision of a non-existent social order haunting my mind. I first saw it during the [Caminhada pela Agua](https://youtu.be/YfV_BzZ9K70), and it hasn't left since. The details vary, but overall it looks like a [holarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holarchy) structure of ever-greater (or ever-smaller) social units.{% sidenote "Although it isn't *exactly* a holarchy, for the same reason that [a city is not a tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_City_is_Not_a_Tree)." %}

A few specific units are always in the list,{% sidenote "The [water basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin) also appears, every time, usually as the starting point." %} particularly the first three: individuals, as the smallest units worth considering, groups of three to twelve individuals,{% sidenote "I don't have a name for this yet, but I think it's the answer to my second question." %} and groups of thirty to sixty individuals.

This final type of social unit I'll call a "household", here.

{% newthought "The households I see," %} aside from being roughly the same size, are extremely diverse. It might not even be right to say they're all part of one culture; they're a transcultural constant.

A household might be identified with a single building, or many, or none -- it may be entirely nomadic. It may be part of a village or stand on its own. The individuals in it may be in it for life, or they might be constantly changing, as new ones join and old ones depart.

{% newthought "How do you join" %} a household, you might ask? Why, you marry into it, of course.{% sidenote "I don't mean to imply that you marry a particular *individual* in the household. That would create all kinds of social complications; I think only a very crazy culture would do it like that." %}

This vision presents a challenge to me. If I want to live in a world that looks like that, it seems to imply I *must* get married, in the near future, but it doesn't specify exactly what that means.

Some elements are definitely part of it -- like commitment -- and some elements seem to be left entirely up to my own decision.

Vexingly, this includes love, sex, and everything around,{% sidenote "To be exact: [k훮ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama)!" %} which is a topic I've somehow managed to mostly avoid, in the last two years, although it's plainly time for me to face it.

Thus the three questions:{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/ABC_Venn_Diagram.svg" "And how do these sets intersect? [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ABC_Venn_Diagram.svg)" %}

Who am I home with?

Who do I work with?

Who do I love?
