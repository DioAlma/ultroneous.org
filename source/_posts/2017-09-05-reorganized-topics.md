title: Reorganized Topics
category: announcement
tags: language organization learning

The posts on this blog are connected by threads of meaning, which I call "core topics". I try to make these visible by tagging them with certain key words. For example, *language* is one. *Organization* is another.

I just changed these, for twenty-six posts.

In the process I removed three tags entirely: *community*, *chaos* and *education*.{% sidenote "Those threads of meaning still exist; I just chose to stop underlining them, because I think it makes the whole work a little better, the way it turned out." %}

Instead, I added a new tag: *learning*.

{% newthought "It seems appropriate" %} to emphasize this topic, given that I'm moving this blog toward becoming a communication platform for [a cooperative]({% post_url 2017-08-19-cooperative %}) that holds [kaizen]({% post_url 2016-12-25-kaizen-culture %}) as its highest value.

I chose the word "learning", though, instead of "kaizen", because the meaning is more accessible to a wide audience.{% sidenote "I could have chosen \"improvement\", but I prefer \"learning\". It's closer to the heart of what life is about." %}

{% newthought "So far," %} I've only written [one post]({% post_url 2017-01-05-how-adults-fail %}) that really addresses *learning* directly.{% sidenote "I think it's the angriest post on the blog, to date. Most of the *education* posts carry a lot of anger. I expect this to change." %}

Let it be known: I intend to write more.
