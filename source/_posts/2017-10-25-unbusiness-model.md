In [an earlier post]({% post_url 2017-08-19-cooperative %}), I wrote about a concept for an unbusiness. Since then I became part of Veda, a cooperative based on that concept, and, as expected, living the concept has changed it.

I intend to address four topics:
- Revenue
- Budgeting
- Vertical integration
- Offering contributions

My focus is on these three paragraphs, in particular. These are the first two:
> I said at the beginning that the cooperative does not sell any product or service. Its primary source of revenue is [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) mining, which allows it to convert electrical power to financial power, more or less directly.
> 
> With that financial power, it funds its own process of [vertical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration), gradually gaining economic autonomy. It begins by targeting the largest unavoidable expenses, developing self-sufficiency in food, water, fuel and housing. As it becomes more advanced, over years, it moves on to electricity and manufacturing, growing to match and eventually exceed the industrial capabilities of petroleum-based civilization, while staying rooted from the beginning in local regenerative sources of power.

And, a bit later, this is the third:
> From the start, with its initial focus on economics, the cooperative offers 10% of its income to support other people and projects, viewing it as another way of contributing to the quality of the world pattern, and making decisions about who to give to from that basis. As the cooperative gains economic autonomy, and independence from its own revenue stream, it slowly increases the percentage of its income that it donates, until eventually money is no longer useful to it, and it gives away all it generates.

These were written from a theoretical perspective. Now that Veda exists, I can write about where it is today, and where I imagine it going.
