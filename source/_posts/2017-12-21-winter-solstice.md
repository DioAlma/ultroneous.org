Today is the 29th winter solstice of my life, and it's been one year [since I started this blog]({% post_url 2016-12-21-winter-solstice %}).

That day, I made four resolutions, to develop my weaknesses into strengths:
- Common resources
- Common language
- The will to arrive
- The will to receive

It feels to me like I received everything I asked for, along these lines, and more.

{% newthought "I became part" %} of a team. To my team, I gave most of what I had held in private ownership: as a first step, I committed my weekends, and something like a tenth of my money. A month later I gave a bit more than a third of what money remained.{% sidenote "200 bitcoins, to be exact. You can see it in the [Veda credit system](/credit)." %} A month after that, I gave the same amount again.

Last year I set an intention: by the next winter solstice, I will no longer have time or money that is only mine. I knew then that I was setting myself an impossible goal. As expected, I didn't meet it -- and, as expected, I came further than I was able to imagine.

Although, since the year isn't quite over yet, I have one last chance: I can commit all of my time and money, right now.

It's tempting. It's a romantic thought. It wouldn't be honest.

What I can do, being truthful with my own willingness to commit, is to make another step: in writing this, I commit to be available from sunrise on Friday until sunset on Sunday, every week, from now until the next December solstice, and I commit to give [166.3045234 BTC](https://blockchain.info/address/1B916yym1oeQaosLpsM3PRqzejvK93yq1o), [2434680.65432 XRP](https://bithomp.com/explorer/r34TrfYKX34JanQzKAMTzaduRYxLGjfBVd), and 10 EUR for whatever my team in Veda decides.

That's everything in my pockets, essentially.{% sidenote "Technically, none of this is in my pockets. Not even the ten euros; my wallet's in my computer bag." %} I still have more private money, but nearly all of it is in the form of debts people owe me. I intend to settle or forgive all these debts, before February.

As for my time: well, that's a bigger step than money. Right now I'm committed for every week from Saturday morning to Sunday evening, and I want to change that in two ways: I want to increase my commitment, and to make it more precise.

From now until the beginning of next winter,{% sidenote "Let's call it November 7th." %} I commit to use my time for whatever my team in Veda decides, from sunrise on Friday until sunset on Sunday.{% sidenote "This is all relative to my latitude and longitude on Earth at the time, and it assumes I stay in the northern hemisphere. Okay: now it's quite precise." %}

{% newthought "As I write," %} I notice how much my language has changed in the last year.{% sidenote "For example, I use the word \"notice\" more." %} I notice, as well, how far it still is from what feels natural, and how much closer it is now than it was then.
