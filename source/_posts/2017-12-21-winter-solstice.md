Today is the 29th winter solstice of my life, and it's been one year [since I started this blog]({% post_url 2016-12-21-winter-solstice %}).

That day, I made four resolutions, to develop my weaknesses into strengths:
- Common resources
- Common language
- The will to arrive
- The will to receive

Now, I want to evaluate how well I did.

{% newthought "By \"common resources\"," %} I meant sharing responsibility for how I use what's available to me. In my case, almost all I had to offer was time and money; I had, and still have, no more material possessions than fit in a 1-by-2 meter shelf.
