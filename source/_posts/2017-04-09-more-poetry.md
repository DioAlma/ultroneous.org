I expanded the poem from [the last entry]({% post_url 2017-04-06-voice-apsu %}) into four stanzas.

As before, first comes the poetry, and then comes the commentary.

> under your feet the world turns right <br />
> along with every step you take <br />
> another breath out of my chest <br />
> drawn tight just like all of the rest <br />
> of you in that red dress so bright <br />
> in my eyes forever awake <br />
> to see the neverending curve <br />
> across your hips I live to serve <br />
> 
> that look I saw there on your face <br />
> belies a mind of gravid grace <br />
> to know the vastness of the thought <br />
> that drew the corner of your mouth <br />
> up when they said we all are God <br />
> I only want to find some way <br />
> inside the truth within your world <br />
> to see the soul behind unfurled <br />
> 
> you laugh at every joke I hide <br />
> between the words I try to find <br />
> the mind to say the way I feel <br />
> this universe as one whole body <br />
> always dying to be born <br />
> from nothing all creation torn <br />
> a part of it beside of me <br />
> you are the all and all are we <br />
> 
> with you I always seem to be <br />
> a half beat off from harmony <br />
> in contact with the surface of <br />
> a heaven somewhere far above <br />
> this earth where we try to survive <br />
> despite our ignorance and strife <br />
> and pain beyond all measure <br />
> I still want to live to stay in love <br />

I feel the need to say: as much as I personally like it, I don't think this is particularly *good* poetry. Even I can see it's rubbish on a technical level, and I don't know enough about poetry to tell a pentameter from an anceps.

Still, I like it. That's different from most of the creative writing I've done, and it's another point in common with [Their Love Is Like This](/tlilt).

I wrote it as an experiment, and I'd call that experiment a success, now. It's good to know I can still make art, when I set my mind to it. I have no intention to become a poet, though.
