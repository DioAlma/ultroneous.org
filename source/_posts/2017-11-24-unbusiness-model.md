This is a continuation of thoughts from [an earlier article]({% post_url 2017-08-19-cooperative %}), specifically an exploration of two terms: "gift economics" and "vertical integration". I'll go over these as a foundation, and then describe a concept based on them that I'll call an unbusiness model.

{% newthought "By \"gift economics\"" %} I mean the study of [gift economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy), and the application of natural principles discovered there.

One such principle, for example, is non-reciprocity. Seen from a local perspective, most transactions in a gift economy are one-way: value flows purely from the giver to the receiver. There is no exchange. This allows large cycles of value flow to emerge, whereby individual economic actors are constantly well-supplied through chains of giving that may be far too large for human beings to be conscious of in daily awareness.

Other, more obvious principles include generosity and gratitude. To these we can also add integrity, as the quality of respecting boundaries, and surrender, as the quality of allowing boundaries to be crossed.{% sidenote "I borrow the names of these four from the [Wheel of Consent](https://bettymartin.org/videos/), which, although it has nothing directly to do with money, taught me more about gift economics than any other source of knowledge I've encountered up until now." %} The health of a gift economy ultimately derives from the quality of communication and trust{% sidenote "I might define \"consent\" as \"communication of trust (or lack thereof)\"." %} within it, which might show how important boundaries are.

This is a whole realm of study that countless lifetimes can be, and already have been, dedicated to. It encompasses the greater part of the principles underlying the concept I'll describe.

{% newthought "By \"vertical integration\"" %} I mean something similar to [the conventional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration). I define it as the extent to which an economic producer is in ownership of its supply chain. I use the term "economic autonomy" interchangeably.

The image of vertical integration that always comes to my mind is a restaurant with a rooftop garden. Here, the supply of vegetables has been vertically integrated in a literal sense: it's physically on top of the business, with the kitchen that cooks the vegetables below.
