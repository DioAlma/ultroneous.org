Over the last year, I've noticed more [synchronistic events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity) than I have in all the previous years of my life put together.

Last month, on the 14th, I was offered to draw one card from a deck of Vedic{% sidenote "For a big chunk of my adolescence, my nickname was \"Ved\", short for \"Vedaine\", the name of a character I made in World of Warcraft. Imagine my surprise when, years later, I found out how much of the esoteric ideas I was interested in came from \"the Vedas\"." %} divinities. I drew Kali, and did some research on her afterward.

I saw a typical depiction of her on Wikipedia:

{% maincolumn "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Kali_Devi.jpg" %}

I asked myself, "If Kali is another image of the same archetype that Tiamat in [TLILT](/tlilt) belongs to, can I also find an equivalent to Apsu here?"

Then I noticed the guy she's standing on. That's Shiva.{% sidenote "The aspects of Kali and Shiva that most closely resemble Tiamat and Apsu, in TLILT, seem to be [Mahākālī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahakali) and [Mahākāla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah%C4%81k%C4%81la), respectively." %}

I'm sure I've seen that motif before, and never once noticed the serene white figure being tread on by the raging black figure. He was just invisible to me, until I asked the right question. Then he popped right into view.

{% newthought "For another example," %} almost a year ago, during a meditation,{% sidenote "This is the usual term in Tamera for communing with the spirit world. The way I do it is basically [active imagination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_imagination)." %} I asked a question I often ask to finish with: "Is there anything else important for me to know?"

Right away, I got a very distinct image of a simple geometric figure that I couldn't identify. Today, I found it.

{% newthought "At the beginning" %} of the [Caminhada pela Agua](https://youtu.be/YfV_BzZ9K70), we all took pieces of paper at random to pair up with different stones in the stone circle.{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Drombeg_Stone_Circle_West.jpg/640px-Drombeg_Stone_Circle_West.jpg" "There's [a stone circle in Tamera](https://www.tamera.org/project-groups/feminine-peace-wisdom/stone-circle/), by the way. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Drombeg_Stone_Circle_West.jpg)" %}

Mine was the Architect. When I announced it to the group, half the circle laughed, probably because [I am the very model of an ecosystem architect]({% post_url 2016-12-23-ecosystem-architect-song %}). I didn't know where the Architect stone is, though; ever since then, I've intended to go visit it.

{% newthought "This afternoon" %} I walked into a certain building when, coincidentally, it was almost 5 o'clock. I didn't know it, but that was exactly the time and place for the meeting of the group I belonged to before I left for my [one-month community organization experiment]({% post_url 2017-01-17-organization %}).

However, only one person showed up aside from me: the father of the close friend with whom I was translating TLILT into German, before I left.

He{% sidenote "The father, not the close friend." %} happened to be an architect, as well as deeply spiritual. Since it seemed the meeting wouldn't happen, he said he'd go to the stone circle. Meditation sounded like a good idea, so I said I'd like to go with him.

{% newthought "Then something clicked" %} in my mind, and I asked him if he could show me where the Architect stone is. He said he could; actually, he's the one who put it there. He created the cosmogram on it.{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Squaredcircle.svg" "Close, but this isn't it. Between photography and Wikimedia, I choose Wikimedia. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Squaredcircle.svg)" %}

We walked to the stone circle together, and he showed me the stone. I immediately had to laugh; the Architect cosmogram is nearly identical to the inexplicable symbol I saw in my mind's eye many months before.

Now and then, I like to look at the events in my life as though it were all a dream.

Sometimes it makes more sense, that way.
