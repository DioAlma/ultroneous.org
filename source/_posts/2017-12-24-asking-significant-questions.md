The training consisted of learning how to ask significant questions.

Main learning points about significant questions:

* There is a logic trap. One steps into the logic trap, when logic is guiding the questions instead of the questions one asks are guiding the logic. The logic trap is not entirely bad. Depending on the intentions of the asking individual, it is a good tool. For reasoning it is not exactly beneficial. 

* A significant question is a question that has the potential to change something. Either inside the asking individual or the asked individual. 

* It is important to determine the level of the question. This means to distinguish if one is able to receive the outcome or stand, catch or deal with the impact. 

Additional learning point:

* There is not real need in asking a question if one is not able to be vulnerable and open for changes. 

Example: Arne asks for an impact in Spencer and says before Spencer can answer that this impact will would not change Arne's decision. Spencer decides not to answer the question because of the "defense wall" that Arne put up. Arne would like to hear encouragement and is afraid of becoming discouraged for his decision. If Arne is not open to be changed and to be vulnerable, There is no need in asking the question.

Outcome: Arne feels more empowered in reasoning. And knows again more about Spencer aka. feels more connected.
