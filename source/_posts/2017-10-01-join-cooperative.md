The year is 2017, and I am with Ferreira, a great friend of mine, going to visit his cousin. I tell him: “Get ready because for the next hour we will only be talking about Cryptocurrency.” and he replies: “I know.”
One hour later we are leaving his Cousin house with a stash of more Euro bills than what I can count in less than ten minutes.

How did this happen?Well let me tell you.

I was born in Porto, Portugal, studied in a Catholic school for the first seventeen years of my life, fourteen and half if you consider that I joined them when I was two years old. Not much to say about this part of my life other than it sucked.

After I went to study Electrical Engineer, my passion for technologies was present since the age of twelve more or less and this University degree was a big disappointment, I barely understood anything of what they were trying to teach me, and honestly, today, I don’t think they were actually trying to teach something. Non the less, this degree gave me the opportunity to go on the last year of my Masters to make my thesis in San Jose, California and something magical happened here. I realised that I was racist.

I was leaving all my life in the city of Porto, with the same ethnicy, same friends, same culture, same nich of this culture. And still I though I new the world, because I had visited a hand full of countries as a tourist.
When I went to Cali, I went to live in an International House with seventy people from different countries, for the first time I was not part of a majority and I was also not part of a minority, I felt Human, and it was such an amazing liberating felling that initiated my journey as a conscious being.
It was during this year that I started to question many things that the society that I was brought up though me, and I was absolutely shocked with how much manipulation, lies and deceiving I was exposed to all my life.
I became obsessed in making sense of it all, how come Humanity had come to such a point of unconsciousness on all levels. I still had a thesis to complete so I could leave this revolution though set aside for the time being.

I finish my thesis with maximum grade, come back to Portugal and immediately get a job offer to work as an IT Engineer in Oil Rigs, I loved the idea, it had a mixture of my passion for technologies with the adventure of being exposed in the field. Best of all I had half year of payed vacations forever.
Oil is bad?Well sure, but who cares? At this point my consciousness development research had been put on hold and even if it did occurred me the though of “is it good what im going to do?” I replied to my self that at least I am going to see for my self if what all this hippies are saying is true.
Nowadays I can tell yes, it is all true, we have rules for regulations of not spelling Oil and Quemicals into the ocean, it is illegal. Solution? Wait for night time and do it then.

One year into the Job I had enough money to pay the rent of a good flat in front of the Ocean in Porto, I had enough time to Surf and play video games and I had a long lasting relationship and friends that like to spend time with me. Still I was entering in a spiral of depression, I hated money more and more by the separation that creates between people, I was getting sick every-time I had to walk in a super market or a mall, and I felt completely misunderstood by everyone around me.

By this time I decide to say F**k it to everything, and the wise words of my friend Ferreira, at the time the only person that actually directly supported me were: “nem que te fodas mano!” that roughly translates into “not even if you f**k your self!(go for it)”. And I went, I quited my job, gave up my apartment and stored all my possessions in boxes, went online and typed in google “Eco Communities in Europe”, first option that pops up is this incredible looking project that 30 years ago had the intention of building a concrete Utopia and it was in Portugal! Imagine that, what were the odds? It was Tamera, I immediately sent them an email and my luck was with me because they were just about to open for the yearly guest season so I was right on time, I immediately pay for my first month of stay and I decide to question/complain about this money requirement latter, after I got there.

I arrive to Tamera, I still remember the first day the first hour the first thoughts the first everything, I was reborn into the second chapter of my life.

I went tru a deep process of healing and self consciousness development during this time, I work in the garden, learned about Karma Yoga, worked as a builder, as a kitchen helper and did an intensive Community course with seventy other people.

During this time I fell in love with a beautiful lady named Maria, and together we entered in a partnership that lasts until today, I could right a book just about this time that I spent in Tamera, but for now lets just say that I felt that I evolved into the next level of my being.

After the guest season was over me and Maria decided to go travel the world, maybe end up in India and apply all the magic that we learned in Tamera, our first stop was a Pirate beach called Barranco. When we got there we found that we were going to have a baby in about nine months from then.

This made us enter into a sort of a panic because non of us could imagine leaving in a family outside of community, so our first priority at the time was to build community, since it was not so simple to just go back to Tamera.
We made a calling and two friends joined us. We spent the next six months in a house trying to apply everything we learned in Tamera and it was Hell, everything failed and we were all miserable. We had about three months left until the labour so we ended this project and went down south to build our little nest where this baby was going to be welcomed into this world.

The nest turned out beautifully, and the labour was going beautifully aswell, but Rey didn’t want to come out so fast, more than forty hours had passed and we decided that we should go to the Hospital. Here we were treated like criminals, the doctors were screaming at us asking what the hell were we thinking and being absolutely unprofessional about everything, Maria was in panic and I was trying to manage the situation the best I could, but inside in full panic my self.
The only thing calming me down was that Maria’s and Rey’s vitals were stable and the doctors them selves wanted the natural labour to continue and that was a good sign that everything was ok. And then they come with the needles ready to give them to Maria, when we asked what was in this needles they took it as an insult and gave them anyway. On this moment Maria panics and Rey’s vitals drop. The doctors rush into the operation block and refuse my entrance, braking the law, which it seems that doctors don’t have any problem in doing so, actually the law is just some bunch of guide lines if you will.

This story can be transformed into another book, all I can say is that for the next three months Rey was victim of medical abuse and incompetence repeatedly, and because me and Maria were not giving up the fight in letting them do whatever they wanted to do they forbade us to be next to our daughter, after an attempt of mine to take her out of there into a private Hospital they call the CPCJ, a commission with the power to question us as parents and that could result in us losing the possibility to be with Rey permanently.

Three months later Rey is out of the hospital, hurt and sad, and we go to an apartment in Castelo Branco(requirement of the CPCJ) for the next two months, in the mean time we were going to visit a community that gave us home and all the support we could have hopped for, this was Adagatyia, by now Maria’s milk had dried up because she was not allowed to breast feed Rey and in Adagatyia due to some magic of their own Marias milk comes back and the doctors could not believe it. For the first time they were taking us a little bit more seriously, that together with the constant communication of my mother with the CPCJ they finally decide to Archive the process and we could celebrate our freedom for the first time in almost half year.

With hour freedom regained was time to find a safe place where we could call home and focus on creating the environment for our family to live in. This was Adagatyia, a community of about ten people right at the beginning of development, this section of the story could be the third book, so very little I will mention. We applied everything again that we learned in Tamera, we introduced Forum, talking hours, morning circles and we entered in an epic journey of community building. The people were very committed and this was essential because we experienced first hand all the enormous issues that young communities face, from the social to the economical to the environmental, the hole package! But we were there to stay.

Next summer it was burning hot it this desolated land in northern Alentejo, the water was little and Maria decided to go spend some time on my mothers house with Rey. One week later I decide to hitchhike next to them so we could drive back together to Adagatyia. When I get there we get in a very emotional talk with my mother and she revealed to us that the real reason that the CPCJ archived the process was because she agreed with them that at any time that she felt that we were not fit as parents that all she had to do was call them and become the one responsible for Rey, on this moment Maria immediately calls for a Taxi and we escaped Portugal direction Austria so once and for all we could not be treated any longer.

When we get to Austria, with the intention to register Rey as Austrian and expecting to finally fall in the arms of a loving family. We get presented with very similar issues from where we came from, by now it started to become even more clear that no matter where we go in the world we will always have problems as long as we don’t have financial independence, I know that this might seem obvious, and until now I had been doing several jobs here and there to pay for the food and rents, but not enough to pay the debts that in the mean time I had made with Tamera and with a dear friend of mine.
I decide it is time for me to leave and go and find a way that I not only could find peace with money but also invite it fully into my life.

For the first time the Alma family gets separated without any date of return. It was a very hard moment but no option seemed to be available.

I left with fifty Euros in my pocket and a backpack with a blanket and my laptop, I had no idea where to go or what was I going to do, I just knew I had to do something and invite money.

I decided to make a prayer, I prayed to the Universe to please to give me guidance on how can I come to peace with money and have it part of my life as something positive, after this prayer I start to hitchhike. The first person that stops is a Cryptocurrency investor, the sign was more than clear! It was a true miracle and my brain starts immediately to link all the dots in my head as to why Cryptocurrency is much more than just money, how it actually is a political revolution and a humanity evolution all together.

During the next month I was hitchhiking in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, everyone that I met I was talking and spreading crypto, I felt so amazingly good like if I was making a peace activism action at the same time I was making money.
During this time I remembered a friend that I had made two years ago in Tamera, Spencer. I remember that he was also passioned about cryptocurrency and I decided to send him an email asking for a donation.

Spencer immediately replies sharing with me that on the same day that I sent him this email that he was him self praying to the Universe for a team of individuals to approach him to become part of a cooperative with intentions very similar to the ones I had in my head. I immediately tell him that I am on my way!

Searching for a quick way to get back to Portugal to meet with Spencer I read a post on social media of a contact of mine called Arne looking for someone to share the ride to Spain, he had a car but no drivers license, another perfect fit out of the hundreds of perfect fits that had been happening during this last month. 

When I met with him magic happened immediately, we were exactly in the frequency wave of though of intention of activism of everything, he quickly falls in love with crypto as-well and we, two pirates together, initiate the ride of hour lives.

We drive back to Portugal and meet with Spencer, that had the structure for the creation of this cooperative incredibly prepared and studied, I was part of other business cooperatives and I can safely say that the work that we did in the first day surpassed months of work in a normal business coop. Not surprising since we are an unbisness after all!

We get introduced to a completely different way of work from the economical to the social aspect, everything was still like a dream coming to life. He his the organiser and he did organised us incredibly, every time that we met, our minds were clear and our goals clearly set. We were introduced to the technics of one minute management and our productivity was immense, at least compared to what I was used to, Im pretty sure in the future even this amount of productivity will seem small in comparison.

I go to Porto with Arne and this is where the story of the Euro bills that I mentioned in the beginning took place, everywhere I go I still try to spread Crypto and this was just another example, used to catch your attention I admit.

Right now our cooperative is growing, we are going to get a Bus where I will live in and have an office inside, as soon as I can go to Austria to get my family together again and we shall drive back to Portugal and make our home, Adagatyia failed in the mean time as a community and today is an Eco-village family oriented. I don’t know yet where we will live or with who, but I do know that the cooperative is clearly for me where I want to give my full energy work wise and I imagine to live in a community with the people that are part of my cooperative.

Until then, I hope to see you soon.

Lots of Love,
Diogo
