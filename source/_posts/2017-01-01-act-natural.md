A lot of flippant pseudo-wisdom actually points the way to major cornerstones of consciousness development. Plus, unlike the ancient esoteric texts, the junk of casual conversation is often phrased as a simple, practical, learnable skill, if you know what's meant by it.{% sidenote "Or what would be meant, if the speakers had any clue about what they were saying." %} For example: "act natural".

What on Earth does this mean?

{% newthought "The word \"nature\"" %} has deep roots. It comes from Latin "[nātūra](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/natura#Latin)", which usually referred to the quality, essence, character, temperament or inclination of something. Before that there was Proto-Italic "[gnāskōr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Italic/gn%C4%81sk%C5%8Dr)", and then Proto-Indo-European "[genh-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/%C7%B5enh%E2%82%81-)", meaning "to be born" and "to give birth".

"genh-" also led to "[janati](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF#Sanskrit)", in Sanskrit, retaining the meaning "to give birth". That "ja" (ज) is the same as the one in "sahaja", which is a Very Important Word. It literally means something like "co-emergent" or "born together", and it was used to refer to a particular state of being that was sought by the [Sahajayana movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahaja) in 8th century Bengal.

In that state, sahaja samadhi,{% sidenote "\"Co-emergent concentration\". This is a bit more advanced than what I know how to do." %} everything happens naturally. This sounds very desirable, but it still isn't clear what "naturally" means. Until you have some idea of what nature *is*, it's going to be very difficult to act from it.

{% newthought "Many people think" %} of nature as something separate from humanity. "Natural" is used as an antonym of "artificial"{% sidenote "\"Artificial\" has a beautiful etymology, from \"[ars](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ars#Latin)\" and \"[facere](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/facio#Latin)\", \"skill\" and \"make\". An artifact is made with skill." %} or "man-made". This always struck me as a profoundly wrong thought. I flinch every time I see the dichotomy made.

If you have this idea, you might wish to "return to nature", which is an oxymoron. You can't get *ahead* of nature. Nature is what's happening right now. It's equally absurd to accept the separation and think you can move on anyway: you may call yourself a futurist, but in reality you're just writing science fiction. *Creating* the future requires living in the present.

{% newthought "Here's the skill:" %} become aware of your nature, and then bring it forth into action. Very simple. And completely impossible if you imagine your nature is something fixed from birth.{% sidenote "How would I act natural if I confuse my nature with my identity? I would say, \"I'm a naturally quiet person\", and then I would stay quiet. Even when moments come where I have a strong desire to speak, I might hold my tongue, and then congratulate myself afterward about how well I'm staying true to my nature. But that's just lazy thinking. If you aren't *acting*, then you aren't acting natural." %}

Your nature changes from moment to moment. In each moment, you have a *new* nature: a new birth, a new creation, or, rather, the potential of one. It's always something quite specific, but not attached to any particular image of how to bring it out. It can be your nature to write a poem right now, or to punch a hole in the wall.

Both these actions might be equally natural, at the same moment. You can only find this out by experience. You can sense, directly, whether you acted naturally or not: whether you let your nature through, or stopped it somewhere along the way.

{% newthought "You can learn" %} to observe a consistent progression of events: first a formless impulse comes up, then images attach to it, and then one of those images is acted out. When all three events proceed without interruption, you can say you acted naturally in that moment. The span of time from impulse to image is so short it's practically instantaneous, but you can catch it, and that gives you the ability to be creative.

When you can distinguish the impulse from the images that attach to it, you can create new images. This is enormously valuable, because, very often, we have impulses that seem childish, awkward, absurd or evil. Yet the natural impulse never has any qualities: it's just life, wanting to come out. Only images and actions can be good or bad.

A bad image leads to a bad action, most of the time, so we learn to stop the process there. That is the phenomenon we experience as fear. It's what stops you from jumping off the cliff, even though the image comes to you. One skill in the art of acting naturally is to notice that moment of fear, and take the time to give yourself a new image that can allow your nature to unfold without causing any harm.{% sidenote "Bungee jumping isn't the kind of image you need to create. You can't have an impulse to jump, then go away, get a bunch of equipment, come back, and jump safely *with the same impulse*. There is no way to get back the moments we lose to fear. As soon as you feel it, it's over: the moment is past, and the nature you had in that moment died before it was born. This is why we can feel more or less alive. In each moment, we live or not, and we can only live the nature of that moment." %}

{% newthought "Fear can enter" %} even before any images come. Sometimes, we experience bad outcomes so consistently after certain impulses, no matter which image we follow, that we learn to fear the impulse itself. We usually experience this as a "black out" moment.{% sidenote "You might know what I mean if you can remember being asked [a question you can't answer](http://imago.hitherby.com/2004/08/the-place-without-recourse-ii/). These questions vary from one person to another, and from one time to another, but, for example: \"What would you do right now if you had the courage to do anything?\"" %}

In cases like that, we need another strategy. It helps to stay in that moment of black-out, as long as you can stand it, and pay very close attention to what moves in you. It might be a physical sensation, not an image; watch it, attend to it, follow it, see where it leads. Slowly you'll regain the trust that you can at least *imagine* bad things happening, safely, and that makes it much easier to understand the impulses that come before. Once you understand the impulse, you can learn or design better images for it.

{% newthought "I hope" %} some of this helps you to gain back that freedom you knew as a child, or at least as a newborn, when you hadn't learned so much fear yet.

There's no going back, but there's always a way forward, and acting naturally in adulthood is actually quite a lot more fun than it was in childhood. You don't fall on your face so often.
