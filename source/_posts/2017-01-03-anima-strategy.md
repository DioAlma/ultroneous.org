Tomorrow I'm going to have lunch with one of the wise women of my village, because I want help making a plan for my love life.{% sidenote "I'm very pleased that I've orchestrated my life in such a way that things like this can be true." %}

This is already a couple years overdue. The first time I visited Tamera was in July 2014, and I came back to stay in April 2015. Between those two dates{% sidenote "To be really exact: I started to write books on 2014-11-27, and I started TLILT itself on 2014-12-07. I finished the first draft on 2015-02-16, and the first edition, after editing and layout and everything you need for an actual hard copy of a book, on 2015-03-25." %} I wrote a book called [Their Love Is Like This]({{ site.baseurl }}/tlilt), because of certain life-altering events that took place during the nine weeks of my original visit. I still haven't fully processed that time, and the ghosts of it continue to haunt me to this day.

{% newthought "What happened" %} is that I had my first and second face-to-face encounters with living, breathing [anima figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_and_animus).{% sidenote "For clarity: I'm not *completely* sure that what I'm talking about is what Jung meant by \"anima\". What I mean by \"anima figure\" is \"one who bears the image of another's dream woman\". It's not that some people are anima/animus figures and some aren't. We all are, most likely, but not without outside observers who experience us as such. It's the same as being an authority figure. You *are* it if, and only if, someone *sees you as* it." %} Up until then I'd only met them in dreams and fantasies, or seen them incongruously walking the streets of cities and the aisles of stores. All of a sudden, I found myself in a situation where the full dynamic beautiful power of the deep layers of the soul was visible in immediate waking reality.

I can say I fell in love. I don't, in general, because romanticism ruined love{% sidenote "Someone finally made [a five-minute YouTube video](https://youtu.be/jltM5qYn25w) succinctly explaining what I've been trying to say since childhood. Thank you, Alain de Botton!" %} and I don't want to lead anyone to think I have romantic notions about what love means.

{% newthought "The problem is," %} I did not then, and I *still* do not now, know what love means. That is to say, I don't know what I should *do* about it.

I love someone. Great! Now what?

I wrote Their Love Is Like This for three reasons:

1. To gain a better understanding of the [archetypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes), particularly the ones that were suddenly so important in my life.
2. To find out how much I can write in how short a time.{% sidenote "Answer: 57,843 words in the first 20 days, and 131,901 after 100. I had an image of myself as a prolific writer, although I had no tangible evidence of it before. I noticed that the first anima figure was a voracious *reader*, and that made me curious: am I symmetric? It turns out I am, which I think is pretty cool." %}
3. To give my mind something to obsess on, other than the woman who inspired the writing to begin with.

I was successful with all of this, but I didn't learn anything about what I should *do*. If you read TLILT hoping to develop a healthier picture of love, you have a really tough job ahead of you. I had very little control over how the narrative progressed, because I was just letting the archetypes play as they will, and I was constantly fascinated and horrified at the madness that would unfold. *This* is the psychic underground of humanity? No wonder we're in such a mess!

{% newthought "With everything I do" %} in life, I'm trying to build up a culture that makes sense. I don't know of any culture in history, living or dead, that had a sensible idea of how to deal with the phenomenon of love.{% sidenote "The culture of Tamera is actually the best I know, but it isn't good enough. It's less a holistic system that naturally brings about good outcomes for those living in it, and more a disorganized bag of good ideas that you may or may not be smart enough to apply in the appropriate situations." %} I can't simply copy what someone else did, in this case.

Plus, just to make sure I was *really* lost, I've never heard of someone else who saw the anima in anything resembling the way I do.{% sidenote "This came as a *big* surprise to me. A lot of mysterious things in my life retroactively made a kind of sense. I have a love affair with chaos. Of course I do! I can say, without spoiling anything: in Their Love Is Like This, my anima figure is Tiamat." %} I was abruptly faced with the need to navigate a social situation that I had no experience in, *and simultaneously* a spiritual challenge that didn't look anything like anything I've ever read about.

{% newthought "I needed an anima strategy:" %} a general concept of how to respond in a situation like this. I need that as much now as I did then, and I hope the talk tomorrow will help.
