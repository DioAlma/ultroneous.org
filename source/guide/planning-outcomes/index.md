  procedure: # What are the steps in employing this method?
    - "We look at a kanban card in the Planning or Delivering column."
    - "If the purpose of it isn't clear, we set a one-minute goal for it."
    - "We ask: What is the next step to deliver this outcome?"
    - "We write the answer as a subtask, if it isn't one already."
    - "We reallocate our resources until we expect success or accept failure."
    - "When we accept failure, we pull the card to celebrating and write a comment on it to answer the question: Why did this fail?"
    - "When we expect success, we pull the card to delivering and set a due date to answer the question: When will this happen?"

  principles: # How does this method work? (What are the traps to avoid?)
    - "We evaluate our method of planning based on how swiftly and elegantly it brings desired outcomes and expected outcomes into alignment."
    - "We stay focused on the present and the future, dismissing costs that have already been paid."
    - "We challenge one another to reveal our true expectations, questions, concerns and doubts."
    - "We stay with one card, refusing to move on, until we either expect success or accept failure."
