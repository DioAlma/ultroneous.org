title: How is Veda organized?
---

Veda is organized as a heterarchical sociocratic cooperative.

It consists of [teams](/people). Each team is its own project, with its own goals. As a heterarchical organization, there is no team in Veda that holds ultimate authority. Every team defers to the authority of the others in their own domains of responsibility and expertise.

Each team makes decisions autonomously, according to its own methods. Decisions in Veda as a whole emerge through the sociocratic practice of [double-linking](/methods/double-linking).
