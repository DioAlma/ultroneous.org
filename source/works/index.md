## Their Love Is Like This

A work of fiction written by Spencer Campbell in 2014, in a fugue of lovesick inspiration that produced 250 pages in about nine weeks.{% sidenote "The first words were written on 2014-12-07, and the first draft, which hasn't changed much since, was finished on 2015-02-16." %}

The writing is entirely unlike what you'll find on this site. The beliefs and values of the characters are different to those of the author.{% sidenote "The author is frankly a little freaked out by the whole thing. It doesn't feel like he wrote it. It's one of his favorite books, though, so he's more happy than disturbed by its existence." %}
