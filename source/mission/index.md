title: What do we do?
---

(This page is a draft, not yet ready for public sharing.)

The purpose of Veda is to employ the people, places, materials and knowledge of collapsing cultures in our regeneration as a planet.

We do this by:
- Offering directions and resources for displaced and disillusioned people to arrive home.
- Following the dreams of the heart, guiding us to care for that which truly matters: who and what we love.
- Challenging ourselves to be of service in all we are asked to do, to learn ever more of our potential and continuously improve our work.
