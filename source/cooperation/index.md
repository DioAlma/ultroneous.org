This page is meant to encourage the formation of [a cooperative]({% post_url 2017-08-19-cooperative %}).

At the moment it's a list of tasks, and it's very new. It may change rapidly through dialogue in the comments, below.

For tasks that require changing this site: if you know [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) you can make contributions on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/ultroneous-org/ultroneous.org).

## 2017-09-02 Create a profiles page

As mentioned in [this post]({% post_url 2017-09-02-roles-cooperative %}), there's an idea to make a page of profiles for people who have a role in this site's cooperative.

It should be very simple, just a long page of small profiles,{% sidenote "You could use [Liquid templating](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/), to generate the list of profiles automatically from a YAML file in the `_data` directory." %} with each profile having these elements:
* A picture of the person{% sidenote "You could just use the person's [Gravatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravatar) image as their profile picture." %}
* The person's name and role in the cooperative
* A paragraph describing the person
* A paragraph describing the person's connection to the cooperative

Can you contribute code for a page like that?

## 2017-09-02 Find a change story for energy autonomy

[Tamera](http://tamera.org) is in the process of becoming independent from fossil fuel, and we need to come together as a community to make that change happen.

A springboard story would help. It should meet the following criteria:{% sidenote "These are taken from *The Leader's Guide to Storytelling*, written by [Steve Denning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Denning)." %}
* The change idea behind the story is crystal clear.
* The story is based on an actual example where the change was successfully implemented -- that is, it's a true story.
* The story is told from the point of view of a single protagonist.
* The protagonist is typical of the audience. (In this case, a mix of political activists, green technologists, deep ecologists, love and consciousness researchers, all living together in one highly interconnected community.)
* The story gives the date and place where it happened.
* The story makes clear what would have happened without the change idea.
* The story is told with little detail -- it's told in a minimalist fashion.
* The story has a positive tone -- it has an authentically happy ending.
* The story is linked to the purpose to be achieved in telling it. (In this case, making Tamera energy autonomous.)

Ideal would be a story of an ecovillage successfully transitioning to 100% energy autonomy, within a short time. A story of a conventional village, an intentional community, or something like a factory belonging to an organization, could also work. A story of a partial transition could also help, if it's still inspiring.

Can you find a story like that?
